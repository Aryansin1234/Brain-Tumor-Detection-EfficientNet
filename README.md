## Project Overview
Brain tumor detection is a complex challenge, but our project tackles it head-on We're using a convolutional neural network (CNN) to classify brain tumors into four categories: Glioma, Meningioma, Pituitary, and No Tumor. The web application integrates the trained CNN model to make predictions on user-uploaded images.

## Dataset
The dataset includes 7023 medical images across four classes:

- **Glioma Tumor**: 1621 images
- **Meningioma Tumor**: 1645 images
- **No Tumor**: 2000 images
- **Pituitary Tumor**: 1757 images

Organized as follows:

## Installation
1. **Clone the Repository**:  
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/brain-tumor-detection.git
    ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:  
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. **Prepare the Dataset**:  
    Ensure you have the dataset in the specified directory structure (`/dataset/Training` and `/dataset/Testing`).

## Getting Started
1. **Run the Flask Application**:  
    ```bash
    python Webapp.py
    ```

2. **Navigate to the Web App**:  
    Open your web browser and go to `http://127.0.0.1:5000/`.

3. **Upload Your Image**:  
    Upload an image of a brain scan through the web interface and receive predictions and confidence levels.

## Model Architecture
Our updated CNN architecture leverages the latest advancements in deep learning for enhanced performance. Key components include:

- **EfficientNetB3 Base Model**: The pre-trained EfficientNetB3 model is used as the base model, excluding the top classification layer. Utilized for robust feature extraction, benefiting from its proven efficiency and effectiveness in image recognition tasks.
- **Batch Normalization**:  Helps in stabilizing the training process and reducing the impact of internal covariate shift.
- **Dense Layers**: Fully connected layers with L1 and L2 regularization to prevent overfitting.
- **Dropout Layer**: Introduces dropout regularization to further reduce overfitting.
- **Softmax Output Layer**: Configured for multi-class classification, accurately predicting among the four tumor categories.

## Training the Model
The training process has been refined to maximize the model's accuracy and efficiency:

1. **Advanced Data Augmentation**: Employed more aggressive data augmentation techniques to increase the diversity of the training set, enhancing the model's ability to generalize.
2. **Optimizer Selection**: Experimented with various optimizers, settling on a combination that offers a balance between convergence speed and stability.
3. **Regularization Strategies**: Applied stricter regularization techniques to mitigate overfitting, ensuring the model performs well on unseen data.
4. **Early Stopping Optimization**: Implemented a more sophisticated early stopping mechanism to halt training at the optimal point, based on validation loss trends.

## Evaluation & Metrics
The model's performance is rigorously assessed using a comprehensive suite of evaluation metrics:

- **Enhanced Precision and Recall**: Calculated for each tumor category to ensure the model accurately identifies positive cases without too many false positives or negatives.
- **F1-Score**: Used as a harmonic mean of precision and recall, providing a single metric that balances both types of errors.
- **Confusion Matrix Analysis**: Conducted a detailed analysis of the confusion matrix to gain insights into the model's classification errors, guiding further improvements.

## Deployment
Deploy the trained model as a web application using Flask. Options for deployment include local servers or cloud platforms (AWS, GCP). Consider using Docker for containerization.
